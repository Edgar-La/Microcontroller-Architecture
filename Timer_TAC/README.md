# TACTL & TAR
In this code I implemented the TACTL command.
The simulation will count up to 10 times, because that is how it was specified in the code.

You can find the code [here](https://github.com/Edgar-La/Microcontroller-Architecture/blob/main/Timer_TAC/main.c).

Also, you can find the simulation [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVJU0Lcr0i9syNrIT7banU2RGQp7om3t/view?usp=sharing).
